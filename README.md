# Social Automation

Automate social media actions via the browser console.

## Linkedin

### Accept and Send Message

It's as simple as it sounds... running this script on a profile page which has a pending connection request will:

1. Accept the connection request
2. Start a new message to this person with a prefilled template. It won't automatically send it though.

Customize the `generatePersonalizeMessage()` function to edit the default prefilled message.

**File: [`/linkedin/acceptMessage.js`](/linkedin/acceptMessage.js)**

Might add more social media platforms/scripts in the future.
